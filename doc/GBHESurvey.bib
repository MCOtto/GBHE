  abstract  = {The Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) is a Species of Special Concern in the State of Maine, USA, due to declines along the Atlantic coast since the mid-1980s. To determine if this decline was statewide, an aerial survey was conducted from 1 May to 18 June 2015 to estimate the breeding population using a stratified dualframe design accounting for imperfect detection of colonies. The strata were based on habitat and known colony densities. The area frame consisted of 10-km x 10-km plots. Stratum samples were searched by air independently by front and rear observers for known and new colonies. The list frame consisted of plots containing known colonies, a sample of which was checked for nesting activity. The dual-frame design combined the strengths of both list- and area-only surveys. Flying directly to known colonies in the list frame was very efficient, and accounting for new colonies in the area frame, allowed unbiased, statistically valid estimation. Estimates were calculated for a Maine statewide total of active Great Blue Heron colonies (n = 243, 90% credible interval (CI) = 193–352), total nests (n = 2,019, CI = 1,778–2,434), and active nests (n = 1,593, CI = 1,416–1,872). Observer detection ranged from 25 to 99%. The percentage of list frame colony coverage in the dual-frame estimate was 63%, but varied by stratum. The percent CV of the dual-frame statewide total active nests was 8.9%, but also varied by stratum. By repeating these methods, strata and statewide population trends could be obtained.},

  abstract = {Summary N-mixture models describe count data replicated in time and across sites in terms of abundance N and detectability p. They are popular because they allow inference about N while controlling for factors that influence p without the need for marking animals. Using a capture–recapture perspective, we show that the loss of information that results from not marking animals is critical, making reliable statistical modeling of N and p problematic using just count data. One cannot reliably fit a model in which the detection probabilities are distinct among repeat visits as this model is overspecified. This makes uncontrolled variation in p problematic. By counter example, we show that even if p is constant after adjusting for covariate effects (the ``constant p'' assumption) scientifically plausible alternative models in which N (or its expectation) is non-identifiable or does not even exist as a parameter, lead to data that are practically indistinguishable from data generated under an N-mixture model. This is particularly the case for sparse data as is commonly seen in applications. We conclude that under the constant p assumption reliable inference is only possible for relative abundance in the absence of questionable and/or untestable assumptions or with better quality data than seen in typical applications. Relative abundance models for counts can be readily fitted using Poisson regression in standard software such as R and are sufficiently flexible to allow controlling for p through the use covariates while simultaneously modeling variation in relative abundance. If users require estimates of absolute abundance, they should collect auxiliary data that help with estimation of p.},

  abstract = {Methods are being developed to capitalize on citizen science data for research and monitoring, but these data are rarely used within established decision-making frameworks of wildlife agencies. Citizen science data are often collected at higher resolution and extent than targeted monitoring programs, and may provide complementary information. Here, we demonstrate that carefully filtered semi-structured citizen science observations, when paired with targeted survey data, can produce ecological predictions at higher resolution and extent than targeted surveys alone, and both datasets can represent complementary aspects of species' ecology. We present case studies demonstrating how citizen science data can enhance or supplement decision-making of government and conservation organizations. First, we show how the continuous spatial coverage of citizen science projects, when coupled with targeted surveys, can improve estimates of metrics used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in regulatory processes to estimate population size, and inform take limits of federally managed species nationwide. Second, we show that the spatial coverage of citizen science accommodates dynamic avian space use patterns during key times of the year, relative to standardized monitoring protocols carried out by the Illinois Natural History Survey. Lastly, we demonstrate that citizen science information can replicate estimates of migratory chronologies for the Illinois Natural History Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for some waterfowl species, and in some contexts can supplement missing data on abundance. These findings illustrate the value of integrating validated information from semi-structured citizen science into the current evidence base used to justify, inform, and evaluate conservation decision-making.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article considers the case where two surveys collect data on a common variable, with one survey being much smaller than the other. The smaller survey collects data on an additional variable of interest, related to the common variable collected in the two surveys, and out-of-scope with respect to the larger survey. Estimation of the two related variables is of interest at domains defined at a granular level. We propose a multilevel model for integrating data from the two surveys, by reconciling survey estimates available for the common variable, accounting for the relationship between the two variables, and expanding estimation for the other variable, for all the domains of interest. The model is specified as a hierarchical Bayes model for domain-level survey data, and posterior distributions are constructed for the two variables of interest. A synthetic estimation approach is considered as an alternative to the hierarchical modelling approach. The methodology is applied to wage and benefits estimation using data from the National Compensation Survey and the Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor, United States.},

  abstract = {{We demonstrate the potential for borrowing strength from estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS), the largest US household survey, to improve estimates from smaller US household surveys. We do this using simple bivariate area-level models to exploit strong relationships between population characteristics estimated by the smaller surveys and ACS estimates of the same, or closely related, quantities. We illustrate this idea with two applications. The first shows impressive variance reductions for state estimates of health insurance coverage from the National Health Interview Survey when modeling these jointly with corresponding ACS estimates. The second application shows impressive variance reductions in ACS one-year county estimates of poverty of school-aged children from modeling these jointly with previous ACS five-year county estimates of school-age poverty. Simple theoretical calculations show how the amount of variance reduction depends on characteristics of the underlying data. In our applications, we examine three alternative bivariate models, starting with a simple bivariate Gaussian model. Since our applications involve modeling proportions, we also examine a bivariate binomial logit normal model, and an unmatched model that combines the Gaussian sampling model with the bivariate logit normal model for the population proportions. Given the strong relationships between the population characteristics estimated by the smaller surveys and the corresponding ACS estimates, and the low levels of sampling error in the ACS estimates, the models achieve large variance reductions even without using regression covariates drawn from auxiliary data sources.}},
