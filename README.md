R Project for the 2023 Great Blue Heron Survey in Maine

This project includes estimating optimal stratum sample sizes, sample selection, and estimation. 

This survey used GRTS for the sample selection.  It had half the plots from the 2015 survey.  The survey can be estimated with the 2015 data using random plot effects.
